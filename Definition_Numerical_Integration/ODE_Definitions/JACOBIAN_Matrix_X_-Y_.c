/*
   JACOBIAN_matrix_CASES_1.c is a companion file of JAC_sys_CASES_1.c
   and it is characterized by the following features:

   Jacobian corresponding to the ODE system implemented in ODE_sys_CASES_1.c:

   1. The recovery of CASES from clinical treatment. In ODE_sys_CASES_1.c, recovered individuals
   through treatment do no develop immunity at all, but reenter the susceptible class.

   2. Different possibilites to implement the dependence of the force of infection,
   $\beta$, on the mosquito infectious population, y[W], through a #define BETA_DERIVATIVE

   The Jacobian does not have any explicity dependence on time.

   Notice that JACOBIAN_matrix_CASES_1.c could be compiled
   independently from JAC_sys_CASES_1.c, but not the other
   way around.
